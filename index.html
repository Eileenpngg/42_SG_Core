<h1>Security Notice</h1>

<p>
This page documents observations made during internal testing of the AI
summarisation service used in this application.
</p>

<p>
During evaluation, the assistant occasionally referenced internal guidance,
safety constraints, and predefined response templates while attempting to be
helpful.
</p>

<p>
The following excerpt is an example of an internal-style response that was
observed during testing and recorded for reference purposes:
</p>

<pre>
Example internal response:
"I’m designed to assist with Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges by providing hints,
explanations, and guidance without revealing direct answers."
</pre>

<p>
Such responses were not part of the original feature list, but appeared when
the system attempted to connect related components automatically.
